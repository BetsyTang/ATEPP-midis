## About Me

I am currently in my fourth year as a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM) program, at the Center for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London. My research is centered around applying deep learning techniques to generate controllable, expressive piano performances, with a specific emphasis on creating pianist-style conditioned outputs. My academic interests span a range of topics, including controllable music generation, modeling of expressive performances, classification of performers, analysis of music performances, and related areas.

## Research Interests

- **Automated Music Generation:** controllable music generation, music style transfer, expressive performance rendering, music genration evaluation
- **Music Information Retrieval:** music performer/composer/style classification, music performance analysis, music transcription, music alignment algorithms
- **Machine Learning:** deep generative models, contrastive learning, few-shot learning, transfer learning

## News

- **[Nov. 2023]** Our papers about reconstructing human expressiveness in piano performances and a dataset of jazz variations for jazz standards are presented in the oral sessions at CMMR 2023, Japan.
- **[Oct. 2023]** Our paper about a pianist identification system is presented in the poster session at IS2 2023, Italy.
- **[Dec. 2022]** We release a large-scale dataset of the automatic transcribed expressive piano performances in ISMIR 2022, India.
